# README

This repository contains run_analysis.R and a code book.

* The run_analysis.R has a function called run_analysis(). If you have the Samsung dataset in your workdirectory, you can call for the function to get the tidy dataset. The function run_analysis() will output a text file called "data_I.txt" in the workdirectory for the Question I, and return a data frame called data_II for the Question II. 

* The code book will offer the essential explanation for the output dataset.
